## Tailwind CSS

- This project uses Tailwind CSS (v4) for styling.
- Tailwind is configured CSS-first via `src/styles.css` (`@import "tailwindcss";`); there is no `tailwind.config.js`. Customise the theme with `@theme` in that file.
- Tailwind class sorting is handled by Oxfmt's `sortTailwindcss` option in `.oxfmtrc.json`, so classes are reordered automatically on format.
