## Project Structure

- `src/lib` contains the project's library code, grouped by domain via this naming convention (e.g. for a `todos` domain):
  - `todos.server.ts` — server-only code, usually paired with `todos.server.test.ts` to unit test it.
  - `todos.functions.ts` — a thin wrapper exposing server functions, importing from `todos.server.ts`.
  - `todos.schemas.ts` — Zod schemas for the domain.
  - `todos.ts` — isomorphic code that can run on either the client or server (e.g. date helpers), usually paired with `todos.test.ts` to unit test it.

## User Interface

- This project uses Tailwind CSS (v4) for styling.
- Tailwind is configured CSS-first via `src/styles.css` (`@import "tailwindcss";`); there is no `tailwind.config.js`. Customise the theme with `@theme` in that file.
- Tailwind class sorting is handled by Oxfmt's `sortTailwindcss` option in `.oxfmtrc.json`, so classes are reordered automatically on format.

## Workflow

- After making changes:
  - Run the linter with `bun run lint`
  - Build and typecheck the project with `bun run build`
